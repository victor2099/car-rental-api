🔀 Redirect After Payment

In your rent request payload, you set a redirect_url.
After checkout, Flutterwave redirects the user to this URL with query parameters:

https://yourapp.com/?status=successful&tx_ref=car-rental-1692393000000&transaction_id=1234567
status → payment status (successful, cancelled, failed)
tx_ref → your transaction reference
transaction_id → id of transaction
